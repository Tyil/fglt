## Choosing a client

[Connect now via webchat](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/sqt)

The webchat is OK as a means of connection for those new to IRC, but if you end
up having fun in our channel and decide to stick around, you will be
<del>harassed</del> <ins>encouraged</ins> to switch to a local client instead:

* [HexChat](https://hexchat.github.io/) (GUI)
* [Irssi](https://irssi.org/) (terminal)
* [WeeChat](https://weechat.org/) (terminal)

Your operating system's package manager very likely includes packages for at
least one of these.  HexChat is probably the easiest for anyone without much
experience with terminal programs.
