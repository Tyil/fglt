Welcome to [/fg/lt/](https://boards.4chan.org/g/catalog#s=fglt)—or as I've
recently taken to calling it, "/fg+lt/". We are always open to users of all
levels, including absolute beginners.

There are many ways to try using GNU/Linux as your operating system.  You can:

1. Install GNU/Linux on a virtual machine (VM), using
   [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
2. Boot from a [Live CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_CD) for a supported
   distribution.
3. Dual-boot GNU/Linux with your usual operating system (a bit more
   challenging).
4. Go *balls deep*, and install GNU/Linux as the only operating system on your
   computer (hard mode).

Before asking questions, please search for the answers on the [resources
page](/resources.html).

Please be civil—note the word "Friendly" in every "Friendly GNU/Linux Thread".

Understand that much of your software from Windows will be unavailable,
although maybe [Wine](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine) can make up for
it.

Check out the [IRC guide](/irc.html) in case you want more real-time
discussion.

## Fediverse (Pleroma, Mastodon, GNU Social, etc)

/fg/lt/ also has [its own instance](https://soc.fglt.nl/) on the
[Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse).  You are most welcome to
join and shitp—err, *converse* with us.
