Welcome to [/fg/lt/](http://boards.4chan.org/g/catalog#s=flt), or as I've
recently taken to calling it, /fg+lt/. We are always open to users of all
levels, including absolute beginners.

There are four ways to try GNU/Linux, you can:

0. Install a GNU/Linux OS on a VM (Virtual Machine/VirtualBox) for "safety
   purposes"
1. Use the Live ISO directly without installing anything, that way, you can get
   a "full GNU/Linux experience".
2. Dual-boot GNU/Linux with Windows/Mac (recommended if you want to learn more
   about GNU/Linux)
3. Go balls deep and overwrite everything with GNU/Linux

Before asking, please search for answers to your questions in resources.

Please be civil, notice the "**Friendly**" in every Friendly GNU/Linux Thread.

Understand that much of your software from Windows will be unavailable,
although maybe WINE can make up for it.

Check out the [IRC guide]({{ "irc.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) in case you
want more real-time discussion.
