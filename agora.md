Dialogues
---------

Starting in June 2020, the [#sqt IRC channel](/irc.html) had a steady stream of
newbies coming in, one of whom ended up regularly engaging with one of the more
experienced and knowledgeable other participants of the channel in long
dialogues, with occasional participation/commentary/heckling from others in the
channel.  Later on, we realised they might make instructive reading for anyone
introduced in the same topics, and so decided to publish them here.  So far,
they have concentrated on computer engineering and industry.

The names are changed and there's a little editing and correction for clarity,
and some footnotes, but it represents the conversations pretty well as they
happened.
